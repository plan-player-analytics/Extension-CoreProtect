DataExtension for [CoreProtect plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/)

- [DataExtension API Documentation](https://github.com/plan-player-analytics/Plan/wiki/APIv5)

## Archived

This Extension is archived and is no longer included in Plan due to the CoreProtect API using too much resources when performing queries, leading to server crashes when WorldEdit had stored its modifications in the database.
